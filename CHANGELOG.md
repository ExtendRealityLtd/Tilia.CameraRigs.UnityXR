# Changelog

## 1.0.0 (2019-10-29)

#### Features

* **structure:** create initial prefab and user guides ([7bd8819](https://github.com/ExtendRealityLtd/Tilia.CameraRigs.UnityXR/commit/7bd881914b5ecb3b0309707b84ccee415e9b80ed))
  > The structure of the repository has been created with all the required files for the package, the prefab and the documentation.

#### Bug Fixes

* **package.json:** include Documentation directory with package ([6ed9224](https://github.com/ExtendRealityLtd/Tilia.CameraRigs.UnityXR/commit/6ed9224309579abb22bc5292cfb563fa154c1c0a))
  > The Documentation directory should be included with the package so the built package has the required documentation for users to refer to when the package is installed.
