## Introduction

The `CameraRigs.UnityXR` prefab provides a spatial camera rig and controller setup utilizing the legacy XR management system in the Unity software. This prefab can be included in a [Unity] software project via the [Unity Package Manager].

> The legacy XR management system was deprecated in Unity `2019.3.0f1`, please use the [Tilia.CameraRigs.XRPluginFramework.Unity] package for support with the new Unity XR Plugin Framework.

## Let's Start

### Step 1: Creating a Unity project

> You may skip this step if you already have a Unity project to import the package into.

* Create a new project in the Unity software version `2018.3.10f1` (or above) using `3D Template` or open an existing project.

### Step 2: Configuring the Unity project

* Ensure `Virtual Reality Supported` is checked:
  * In the Unity software select `Main Menu -> Edit -> Project Settings` to open the `Project Settings` window.
  * Select `Player` from the left hand menu in the `Project Settings` window.
  * In the `Player` settings panel expand `XR Settings`.
  * In `XR Settings` ensure the `Virtual Reality Supported` option is checked.
* Ensure the project `Scripting Runtime Version` is set to `.NET 4.x Equivalent`:
  * In the Unity software select `Main Menu -> Edit -> Project Settings` to open the `Project Settings` inspector.
  * Select `Player` from the left hand menu in the `Project Settings` window.
  * In the `Player` settings panel expand `Other Settings`.
  * Ensure the `Scripting Runtime Version` is set to `.NET 4.x Equivalent`.

> **Note:** Unity `2019.1` (or above) requires additional project setup before importing this package.

* Download and install the `XR Legacy Input Helpers` from the Unity Package Manager.
  * In the Unity software select `Main Menu -> Window -> Package Manager` to open the `Package Manager` window.
  * Select `XR Legacy Input Helpers` from the `Packages` tab in the `Package Manager` window.
  * Click the `Install` button located in the bottom right of the `Package Manager` window.
  * The `XR Legacy Input Helpers` package will now download and install into the project.

### Step 3: Adding the package to the Unity project manifest

* Navigate to the `Packages` directory of your project.
* Adjust the [project manifest file][Project-Manifest] `manifest.json` in a text editor.
  * Ensure `https://registry.npmjs.org/` is part of `scopedRegistries`.
    * Ensure `io.extendreality` is part of `scopes`.
  * Add `io.extendreality.tilia.camerarigs.unityxr` to `dependencies`, stating the latest version.

  A minimal example ends up looking like this. Please note that the version `X.Y.Z` stated here is to be replaced with [the latest released version][Latest-Release] which is currently [![Release][Version-Release]][Releases].
  ```json
  {
    "scopedRegistries": [
      {
        "name": "npmjs",
        "url": "https://registry.npmjs.org/",
        "scopes": [
          "io.extendreality"
        ]
      }
    ],
    "dependencies": {
      "io.extendreality.tilia.camerarigs.unityxr": "X.Y.Z",
      ...
    }
  }
  ```
* Switch back to the Unity software and wait for it to finish importing the added package.

### Done

The `Tilia CameraRigs UnityXR` package will now be available in your Unity project `Packages` directory ready for use in your project.

The package will now also show up in the Unity Package Manager UI. From then on the package can be updated by selecting the package in the Unity Package Manager and clicking on the `Update` button or using the version selection UI.
